This package should be installed with LabVIEW package manager.  The epics shared library that you've built using the EPICS build system should be placed in the path on the target.  If you're building for windows, then lvPortDriver.dll and other EPICS shared libraries should be placed in your system path before starting LabVIEW. If the dll is not in the path, then LabVIEW will ask you to search for it for every .vi that uses it.  This package also includes a caQTDM screen that interacts with the lvtest ioc for the example.
